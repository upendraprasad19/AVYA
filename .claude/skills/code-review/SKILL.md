# Code Review (B-pass) — Fresh-agent Adversarial Pass

> Track 1 of the 2026-05-28 six-industry-gap closure batch. **Per-commit lightweight reviewer.** Different from `/hermes-pass` (per-batch deep cross-lens pass).

## 0. When to invoke

- **Reminder-triggered** by `scripts/pre-commit.sh` — it PRINTS a `NOTE: blast-radius=<tier> (>=account) — run /code-review (B-pass)` nudge when the staged blast-radius is ≥ `account` (per `docs/blast_radius.yaml`). Git hooks **cannot invoke Claude skills**, so this is a printed reminder; run `/code-review` **manually** when you see it. (Corrected lean-workflow batch 2026-06-01 — the prior "auto-triggered" wording described behaviour the hook never had.)
- **Required** for commits with blast-radius `catastrophic` (gate `check_code_review_pass_exists.dart` blocks without an `accepted` verdict)
- **Manual**: `/review` any time, including pre-push and pre-batch-finalization
- **Skip**: commits with blast-radius `feature` (cost > value)

## 1. The contract

This skill produces a structured findings file at `docs/reviews/<staging-hash-or-sha>-review.md`.

# Code Review — <staging-hash>

## Finding 1 — P0 — writer_reader_drift
- **file:line:** lib/features/auth/foo.dart:142
- **claim:** `getUserProfile()` reads `profile['email']` but `ProfileWriteService.update` writes `profile['user_email']` per writer/reader drift pattern.
- **verification:** `grep -n "profile\\['email'\\]" lib/` to confirm read sites
- **suggested-fix:** rename read to `profile['user_email']` OR migrate writer
- **status:** pending

## Finding 2 — P2 — secrets_in_tree
- **file:line:** lib/foo.dart:23
- **claim:** Hardcoded API key suffix visible
- **verification:** `git check-ignore -v lib/foo.dart`
- **status:** pending

## 2. Lens set (5 lenses, fast)

Each lens has a focused prompt the dispatched agent runs against the staged diff:

1. **writer_reader_drift** — for every Hive write in the diff, find every cloud reader; for every cloud write, find every Hive reader. Look for field-name or semantic drift. Source: `feedback_writer_reader_field_drift_recurring.md`.
2. **function_exception_swallow** — for every `.functions.invoke(` in the diff, confirm catch + `e.status` + `e.details` is used. Source: `feedback_function_exception_class.md`.
3. **blast_radius_mismatch** — `docs/blast_radius.yaml` says path `X` is tier `T`. Does the diff treat it that way? E.g. catastrophic-tier changes must have rollback documented.
4. **secrets_in_tree** — credential-shaped literals (`sk-`, `rzp_live_`, `AKIA`, `-----BEGIN`) anywhere in the staged diff. Source: `feedback_secrets_pattern_audit_before_first_push.md`.
5. **unawaited_no_error_sink** — every `unawaited(` in the diff has either an inner `.catchError` or sits inside a function with declared error sink. Source: `feedback_observability_silent_drop.md`.

## 3. Dispatch protocol

When invoked, this skill should:

1. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` and `git diff --cached` to assemble the diff.
2. Compute blast-radius via `dart run scripts/blast_radius_from_diff.dart`.
3. Generate a unique staging hash: `sha256(git diff --cached)` truncated to 12 chars.
4. **Dispatch a FRESH Sonnet subagent** via `Agent({subagent_type: 'general-purpose', model: 'sonnet', ...})` with:
   - The diff inline (or list of changed files to Read)
   - The 5 lens prompts
   - Explicit instruction: "find bugs, do not validate; if you find nothing, list what you specifically checked and why each lens returned clean"
   - Output schema (the markdown above)
5. Subagent returns findings — write to `docs/reviews/<staging-hash>-review.md`.
6. Surface the file path in the main conversation; instruct founder to triage.

## 4. Triage workflow

For each finding:
- **accepted** — fix in same batch per `feedback_no_deferrals.md`. Update `status:` field.
- **false_alarm** — annotate `status: false_alarm` with reason. Helps tune the skill via self-evolution.
- **spawn_followup_task** — emit a new task via `TaskCreate`; status becomes `spawned`.

When ALL findings have non-`pending` status, founder sets `verdict: accepted` and the commit can proceed (for catastrophic; for account/platform the verdict is advisory).

## 5. False-positive tracking (self-evolution)

After each invocation, count `false_alarm` findings as a percentage of total. If > 30% on a single pass, that lens is too noisy. Update the lens prompt OR remove the lens entirely. Document the tuning in this SKILL.md under `## Tuning history`.

## 6. Anti-patterns (DO NOT)

- Pass conversation context to the subagent. It must be FRESH — context-blind reviewers catch what the writer missed.
- Default to "no findings found" when uncertain — force structure ("I checked X with grep Y, returned 0 hits").
- Skip the `verification:` field. Every finding must have a one-line verification command.
- Bundle this with `/hermes-pass`. That's a different skill (per-batch, all 53 lenses, Opus, slower).

## 7. Tuning history

> Append after each invocation: invocation date, blast-radius, findings count, false-alarm count, tuning made.
