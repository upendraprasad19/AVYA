- 2026-08-01 ~09:15 IST — trigger: **batch ship** (Unit 5 merged `d229c012`, CI green,
  follow-up units continuing in-session) + long session. Founder ACCEPTED (ran /compact).
  Note: the skill's own step-6 logging was blocked that round because plan mode was active
  and only the plan file was writable — this line is the retroactive entry.
- 2026-08-01 ~11:40 IST — trigger: **explicit** (`/strategic-compact`) + context pressure,
  mid-batch with **nothing committed**. Distinct from every prior invocation: previous ones
  fired at a clean boundary where git history WAS the durable record. Here `HEAD` is
  unchanged and the batch lives only as 24 staged files in a worktree + a failure log in
  /tmp, so the preserve-list is load-bearing rather than a convenience. Founder decision:
  pending at time of writing.
  → Tuning signal: the skill's trigger list assumes a *clean* boundary ("last commit landed",
    "batch has shipped"). It has no entry for "context exhausted mid-batch with a red suite",
    which is the riskiest moment to compact and the one most needing a curated preserve-list.
    Worth adding as an explicit trigger.
