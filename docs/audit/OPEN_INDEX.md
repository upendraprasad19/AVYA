# Open Issues — index (auto-generated)

**81 open.** One line each; full detail in [`open_issues.md`](open_issues.md) at the cited line, so a single entry can be read with `Read(open_issues.md, offset: <line>, limit: 60)` instead of loading the file. Closed history: [`closed_issues.md`](closed_issues.md).

`Blocked on` answers "what can I pick up right now". `Verified` is when the entry was last checked against reality — `never` means the text has not been re-confirmed since it was filed and should be treated as a claim, not a fact. OI-47 read as authoritative for a day while being wrong; that is what this column exists to make visible.

Re-run: `dart run scripts/build_oi_index.dart`
